<h2>Our Story</h2>
<h4>How We Met...</h4>
    <p>Brandon and I met when he was in the band, The Tastydactyls, at one of their shows in California. We got to chatting at the show, I took them to In-N-Out, and Brandon and I became fast friends. We were friends for years, he was always there when I needed him, especially during my English classes.</p>
<h4>How We Fell...</h4>
    <p>In March of 2013 I flew out to Texas, I fell for him over fajitas and banana's foster. We became closer than ever before. We decided to make it work, and Brandon came over to California while I finished up school. I feel so lucky we were able to be friends for 3 years before we started dating. We already knew so much about each other, but we're still learning more and more about each other every day.</p>
<h4>The Proposal...</h4>
    <p>A couple days before Christmas in 2015, we were riding the ferry across Elliot Bay. While we were watching the Seattle city lights reflect over the water, Brandon was telling me he had something he wanted to give to me when we had opened our stocking the night before, I said "is it a scarf?!" he said "kinda?" and then got down on one knee, said "Brittany, I love you, will you marry me?" and I shouted "OF COURSE!"</p>
    <em>We're so happy to be taking the next step in our journey with you by our side!</em>
